Welcome to the Reapp blog.

We've spend a lot of time getting the documentation and presentation of the
website here just right, but it's due time to improve the community. Along
with our own [Gitter channel for chatting](https://gitter.im/reapp/reapp)
and [Twitter account for news](https://twitter.com/reapp),
we're starting this blog.

Reapp is moving at breakneck speed. We have huge ambitions and exciting things
in the pipeline. A Material UI theme is coming. As are new components.

But first, we want to start by
creating the best documentation of any app platform.

Starting this week we'll be publishing a series of articles on using Reapp.
These will be guides on building real-world apps as well as walkthrough on
how to use the more impressive technical features of Reapp.

We already have an exciting full-length walthrough coming out on [Scotch.io](http://scotch.io)
shortly. We have some great [example](https://github.com/reapp/hacker-news-app) [apps](https://github.com/reapp/kitchen-sink)
you can look at for inspiration in structuring your apps.

Finally, we have some big client using Reapp, that will launch their apps in less
time than ever before.

So keep posted here, exciting times are ahead.
